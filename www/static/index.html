            Once upon a time, there was
            <a href="https://dotink.co" target="_blank">Ink</a>.
            Ink was a toy programming language, and I used it to build
            everything from personal productivity apps to compilers to ray
            tracers. Ink was wonderful, but had a handful of shortcomings and
            misfeatures that became more and more obvious over time as I used
            it.
            </p>
            <p>
            Oak is a sequel to Ink that tries to correct many of these early
            mistakes, while being easier to read and use. Oak is intentionally
            not "Ink 2.0" — it's not a simple upgrade or bugfix, but a
            completely different language with quite different semantics and
            syntax.
            </p>
            <p>
            I've been building Oak since early July 2021. The core language and
            basic standard libraries are complete, but still feel too unstable
            to call it ready, and there's a lot missing that I'd like to add to
            Oak's tooling, like compile-to-JavaScript support baked into the
            language, and support for automatic code formatting, testing, and
            documentation generation. This is also why this website is very
            bare today — I haven't had time to stabilize and document much of
            anything yet!
            </p>

            In the meantime, if you're curious about the language, you can
            check out the
            <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/oak" target="_blank">Oak repository</a>
            on GitHub, where you'll find more details about the language and a
            guide on how to try it today.
